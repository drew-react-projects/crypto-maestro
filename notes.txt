- Commit 3: 
  + Import Components in App.js in 1 line
    * Create index.js in components folder
    * export { default as Component } from './Navbar'; in components/index.js
    * import { Navbar } from './components'; in App.js
    * Same things for other Components if you have more
  
  + <Menu.Item icon={<HomeOutlined />}>
    * Remember to use icon as Tag as above line

  + ReactDOM.render(<Router><App /></Router>,document.getElementById('root'));
    * NOTHING RENDERRED and LINKS DONT WORK is you dont wrap Router around App Component like this

- Commit 4: Switch has been replaced with Routes
